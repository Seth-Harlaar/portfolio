// Throughout my software development journey, I have acquired the soft skills it
// takes to be an excellent software developer. Through many hours of
// programming, math, and engineering, in and outside of school, I acquired strong
// skills in problem solving, troubleshooting, and analysis. I have worked on many
// projects with my colleagues and peers, demonstrating my ability to work
// collaboratively. Through a heavy workload in my achievement of a Bachelor of
// Engineering I have learned to be proactive and to multi-task well to tackle
// multiple projects and deliver on time.
